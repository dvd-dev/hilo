**BETA**

This is a Beta version. There will likely be bugs, issues, etc. Thank you for your patience and for opening "Issues".






## 📌 Introduction
This unofficial HACS integration allows you to use [Hilo](https://www.hiloenergie.com/fr-ca/) with Home Assistant. **It is not affiliated with Hilo or Hydro-Québec.**

**⚠️ Do not contact Hilo or Hydro-Québec for issues related to this integration.**

**⚠️ Please make your automations and API calls smartly — Hilo knows we’re here and lets us have access because we don’t abuse it, let’s keep it that way.**

## 🔥 Main Features
✅ Supports switches and dimmers as lights

✅ Thermostat control and temperature reading

✅ Energy consumption monitoring of Hilo devices

✅ Sensor for Hilo challenges and gateway

✅ Configuration via user interface

✅ Authentication via Hilo website

✅ Outdoor weather sensor with changing icon


📌 **To do**: Support for other devices, improvement of consumption meters, API documentation

# ⚠️ Hilo Challenge Sensor ⚠️

### Current State:
- The `allowed_kWh` and `used_kWh` attributes are **partially functional**: the information arrives in fragments, and not all cases are handled yet.
- Some information, such as `total_devices`, `opt_out_devices`, and `pre_heat_devices`, do not **persist in memory**.

---

## 📥 Installation
### 1️⃣ Check Compatibility
- The integration requires Hilo hardware installed and functional.
- Tested on HA OS, Docker (ghcr.io), Podman. Other configurations may cause issues.
- Ongoing issue on Podman/Kubernetes see [issue #497](https://github.com/dvd-dev/hilo/issues/497).

### 2️⃣ File Installation
#### 🔹 Option 1: Via HACS
[![Install via HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=dvd-dev&repository=hilo&category=integration)

1. Make sure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/) installed.
2. In HACS, click `+ EXPLORE & DOWNLOAD REPOSITORIES`, search for "Hilo" and download it.
3. Restart Home Assistant

#### 🔹 Option 2: Manually
1. Download the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/dvd-dev/hilo/releases/latest).
2. Copy `custom_components/hilo` to Home Assistant's `custom_components` folder.
3. Restart Home Assistant

### 3️⃣ Add Integration to Home Assistant
[![Add Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=hilo)

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Integrations**.
2. Click `+ ADD INTEGRATION` and search for "Hilo".
3. Authenticate on the Hilo website and link your account.

## 📌 Power Consumption Tracking
If you want to use automatic generation of power consumption sensors, follow these steps:

1. **Add the `utility_meter` platform**
   Add the following line to your `configuration.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   utility_meter:
   ```

2. **Enable automatic generation**
   - In the integration's user interface, click `Configure`.
   - Check **Generate power consumption meters**.

3. *(Optional)* **Restart Home Assistant**
   - Wait about 5 minutes. The `sensor.hilo_energy_total_low` entity will be created and contain data.
   - **The `status`** should be `collecting`.
   - **The `state`** should be a number greater than 0.
   - All created entities and sensors will be prefixed or suffixed with `hilo_energy_` or `hilo_rate_`.

4. **Known error (to ignore)**
   If you see this error in the Home Assistant log, it can be ignored:
   ```
   2021-11-29 22:03:46 ERROR (MainThread) [homeassistant] Error doing job: Task exception was never retrieved
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   [...]
   ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'None'
   ```

5. **Manual addition to "Energy" dashboard**
   Once created, meters will need to be added manually.

---

## ⚠️ Warning
When activating meters, it is recommended to **remove old manual sensors** to avoid duplicate data.

If you encounter a problem and want to collaborate, enable **debug** logging and provide an excerpt from the `home-assistant.log` file. The method is explained below.

---

## ⚙️ Other Configuration Options
You can configure additional options by clicking `Configure` in Home Assistant:
![alt text](image.png)
### ✅ **Generate power consumption meters**
- Automatically generates power consumption meters.
- **Requires** the following line in `configuration.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  utility_meter:
  ```

### ✅ **Generate only total meters for each device**
- Calculates only the total energy **without division** between low and high cost.

### ✅ **Log request data and Websocket messages**
- Requires **debug logging level** on the integration and `pyhilo`.
- Allows detailed tracking for development and debugging.

### ✅ **Lock `climate` entities during Hilo challenges**
- Prevents any modification of temperature setpoints **during a challenge** Hilo.

### ✅ **Track unknown consumption sources in a separate meter**
- All **non-Hilo** sources are grouped in a dedicated sensor.
- Uses the house's **smart meter** reading.

### 📌 **Hydro-Québec rate name** (`rate d` or `flex d`)
- Define the **rate plan name**.
- **Supported values**:
  - `'rate d'`
  - `'flex d'`

### ⏳ **Update interval (min: 60s)**
- Sets the **number of seconds** between each update.
- **Default value**: `60s`.
- **Don't go below 30s** to avoid suspension from Hilo.
- Since **2023.11.1**, the minimum has increased from **15s to 60s**.
