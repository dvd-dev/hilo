**BETA**

This is a Beta version. There will likely be bugs, issues, etc. Thank you for your patience and for opening "Issues".

# Hilo - Home Assistant
Home Assistant integration for [Hilo](https://www.hiloenergie.com/fr-ca/)

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Major change coming, please keep your component up to date ‚ö†Ô∏è

The API we rely on for Hilo challenges will be shut down soon. We are currently working on an
alternative using Websocket/SignalR. **Updating to version 2025.2.1 or later is strongly recommended**, as
previous versions may stop working due to how pip installs dependencies.

Several users and I are migrating our communications with the Hilo API to Websocket/SignalR
rather than API calls. The process will be gradual and we will do everything we can to avoid
breaking existing installations.

First, we will update the `python-hilo` library (https://github.com/dvd-dev/python-hilo),
this change should be transparent for everyone.

Then, we will migrate the challenge sensor (`sensor.defi_hilo`) to Websocket/SignalR. The good news with this is
that momentary "glitches" of the challenge sensor are completely eliminated by this method.

### What remains to be done on this side:
- The `allowed_kWh` and `used_kWh` attributes are currently **non-functional**, the information arrives in fragments and all
cases are not handled yet.
- ~~- The "completed" state doesn't always work, possibly a race condition~~
- Some information like `total_devices`, `opt_out_devices` and `pre_heat_devices` don't persist in memory.

More details available in [issue #486](https://github.com/dvd-dev/hilo/issues/486).

The API used for initially reading the list of devices on your Hilo account will also undergo the same treatment.

More details available in [issue #564](https://github.com/dvd-dev/hilo/issues/564).

## üìå Introduction

## üì• Installation
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check Compatibility
- The integration requires Hilo hardware installed and functional.
- Tested on HA OS, Docker (ghcr.io), Podman. Other configurations may cause issues.
- Ongoing issue on Podman/Kubernetes see [issue #497](https://github.com/dvd-dev/hilo/issues/497).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ File Installation
#### üîπ Option 1: Via HACS
[![Install via HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=dvd-dev&repository=hilo&category=integration)

1. Make sure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download/) installed.
2. In HACS, click `+ EXPLORE & DOWNLOAD REPOSITORIES`, search for "Hilo" and download it.
3. Restart Home Assistant

#### üîπ Option 2: Manually
1. Download the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/dvd-dev/hilo/releases/latest).
2. Copy `custom_components/hilo` to Home Assistant's `custom_components` folder.
3. Restart Home Assistant

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add Integration to Home Assistant
[![Add Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=hilo)

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Integrations**.
2. Click `+ ADD INTEGRATION` and search for "Hilo".
3. Authenticate on the Hilo website and link your account.

## üìå Power Consumption Tracking
If you want to use automatic generation of power consumption sensors, follow these steps:

1. **Add the `utility_meter` platform**
   Add the following line to your `configuration.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   utility_meter:
   ```

2. **Enable automatic generation**
   - In the integration's user interface, click `Configure`.
   - Check **Generate power consumption meters**.

3. *(Optional)* **Restart Home Assistant**
   - Wait about 5 minutes. The `sensor.hilo_energy_total_low` entity will be created and contain data.
   - **The `status`** should be `collecting`.
   - **The `state`** should be a number greater than 0.
   - All created entities and sensors will be prefixed or suffixed with `hilo_energy_` or `hilo_rate_`.

4. **Known error (to ignore)**
   If you see this error in the Home Assistant log, it can be ignored:
   ```
   2021-11-29 22:03:46 ERROR (MainThread) [homeassistant] Error doing job: Task exception was never retrieved
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   [...]
   ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'None'
   ```

5. **Manual addition to "Energy" dashboard**
   Once created, meters will need to be added manually.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
When activating meters, it is recommended to **remove old manual sensors** to avoid duplicate data.

If you encounter a problem and want to collaborate, enable **debug** logging and provide an excerpt from the `home-assistant.log` file. The method is explained below.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Other Configuration Options
You can configure additional options by clicking `Configure` in Home Assistant:
![alt text](image.png)
### ‚úÖ **Generate power consumption meters**
- Automatically generates power consumption meters.
- **Requires** the following line in `configuration.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  utility_meter:
  ```

### ‚úÖ **Generate only total meters for each device**
- Calculates only the total energy **without division** between low and high cost.

### ‚úÖ **Log request data and Websocket messages**
- Requires **debug logging level** on the integration and `pyhilo`.
- Allows detailed tracking for development and debugging.

### ‚úÖ **Lock `climate` entities during Hilo challenges**
- Prevents any modification of temperature setpoints **during a challenge** Hilo.

### ‚úÖ **Track unknown consumption sources in a separate meter**
- All **non-Hilo** sources are grouped in a dedicated sensor.
- Uses the house's **smart meter** reading.

### üìå **Hydro-Qu√©bec rate name** (`rate d` or `flex d`)
- Define the **rate plan name**.
- **Supported values**:
  - `'rate d'`
  - `'flex d'`

### ‚è≥ **Update interval (min: 60s)**
- Sets the **number of seconds** between each update.
- **Default value**: `60s`.
- **Don't go below 30s** to avoid suspension from Hilo.
- Since **2023.11.1**, the minimum has increased from **15s to 60s**.
